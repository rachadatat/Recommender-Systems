        "# Generate Sentence Embeddings\n",
        "In natural language processing (NLP), sentence embeddings are vector representations that capture the semantic meaning of a whole sentence. Unlike word embeddings, which represent individual words, sentence embeddings attempt to represent the meaning of an entire sentence or phrase.\n",
        "\n",
        "One straightforward method for generating sentence embeddings is by averaging the word embeddings of the words in the sentence. This method assumes that the meaning of a sentence can be approximated by combining the meanings of the individual words that it contains. Here's how the function get_sentence_vector() works to generate sentence embeddings:\n",
        "\n",
        "The function takes a sentence as input, tokenizes it into words, and looks up the corresponding word embeddings for each word in a pre-trained model (such as Word2Vec, GloVe, or FastText).\n",
        "The embeddings of the words are summed up, and the resulting vector is divided by the total number of words found in the model to get an average representation of the sentence.\n",
        "If any word in the sentence is not present in the embedding model, it is ignored, and the remaining words contribute to the final sentence embedding.\n",
        "This method provides a simple yet effective way to represent the semantic meaning of a sentence and can be used in various NLP tasks, including similarity comparison, clustering, or feeding into machine learning models for classification or regression.\n",
        "\n",
